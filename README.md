## Data Cleaning and Preparation
EDA involved exploring the Data to answer some questions about the Data such as:
  - Show sales of Binder and Pencil in 2015?
  - Sales in Central and East Region in 2014?
  - Show sales in in August and September in 2014?
  - Show sales that start with Pen, include their region, sales rep and year?
  - Show sales of items that end with 'sk' include their region, sales rep, and year?

## Data Analysis
This is where we include some basic lines of code or queries of the DAX expressions used during your analysis

```
 - Show sales of Binder and Pencil in 2015?

=QUERY(A:H, "SELECT A,B,C,F WHERE C='Binder' and F=2015 or C='Pencil' and F=2015", 1)

```

```
 - Sales in Central and East Region in 2014?

=QUERY(A:H, "SELECT A,C,H,F WHERE A='Central' and F=2014 or A='East' and F=2014", 1)=QUERY(A:H, "SELECT A,C,H,F WHERE A='Central' and F=2014 or A='East' and F=2014", 1)

```

```
- Show sales in in August and September in 2014?

=QUERY(A:H, "SELECT E,F,H WHERE E='Aug' and F=2014 or E='Sep' and F=2014", 1)

```

```
 - Show sales that start with Pen, include their region, sales rep and year?

=QUERY(A:H, "SELECT A,B,C,F,H WHERE C='Pen' and C LIKE 'Pen%'", 1)

```

```
 - Show sales of items that end with 'sk' include their region, sales rep, and year?

=QUERY(A:H, "SELECT A,B,C,F,H WHERE C LIKE '%sk'", 1)
 
```
